The Earl's Chair is an interesting site near one of the entrances to the [infamous Derrybrien Wind Farm](https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/derrybrien-wind-farm-how-it-all-went-wrong/). This chair like rock formation was used by the local "gentry" as a resting spot when they were hunting in the mountain (hence the name) but the site may also be one of the earliest coronation sites in Connacht.

I went there via the first entrance to the windfarm off the Black Road when coming from the Derrybrien direction. I followed this path and the veered off through the mountain and into a bit of Sitka Spruce plantation where the chair is situated. It was rough going but I eventually came across a small track that leads to the chair.

I followed this track back to the windmills, it was much easier than the way I went in and I had lovely views of East Galway behind me.

I wasn't the only visitor.

On the way down I had lovely views of Lough Derg, Moyglass Lake, and around the Sliabh Aughties.

I even came across a [May Bush](https://thefadingyear.wordpress.com/2020/04/29/the-may-bush-tradition-in-ireland/) (I think that's what it is anyway).

On the way out I was given a reminder of the state of the world.
